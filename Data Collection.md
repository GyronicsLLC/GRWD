This file explains the methodology of the data collection involved in the Gyronics Dataset. Additionally some basic statistics are also provided. 

## Methodology:

Participants were first informed upon the goals of the research their data was being collected for. 

Next the data collecting procedure was explained to them. 
    - They would complete each gesture 10 times.
    - The recorder would explicitly tell the participant when to begin each gesture.
    - If for any reason any gesture required re-collection participants would be expected to repeat the gesture after the recorded told them.
    - If the gesture was completed in a manner distinctly different from the nature of the gesture the recorder would ask the participant to redo the gesture and show an acceptable version of the gesture.

The participants then fastened the device to their forearm of choice. Care was taken to ensure a comfortable yet tight fit was established, so as to avoid noise artefacts as a result of slippage or inertial effects during movement.

The age, build, gender, and hand of choice of the participant was then recorded.

The participants would then perform each gesture a total of 10 times. 

Prior to data collection, the gesture would be explained to the participant along with a visual demonstration of the gesture being made. Participants were explicitly guided to complete the gesture in a manner most comfortable to them.

If this "manner" would misrepresent the gesture the recorded would ask the participant to redo the gesture in an acceptable fashion. (i.e if the P gesture looked more like a circle gesture, the recorder would ask the participant to redo the gesture in a manner more clearly distinguishing the two gestures)
